# 🤝Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! 🎉  
This guide is about contributing **to the template itself**.  
It does not cover projects that are generated from this template.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new feature branch  
3. Make your changes in the **template files**  
   (not in generated project code)  
4. Add or update tests for new functionality  
5. Run locally and ensure all checks pass (`make check`)
6. Commit and push your changes to your fork 
7. Submit a pull request 🚀

## Development setup

Install development dependencies:

```bash
  make dev-setup
```
