CI/CD Setup
===========

Continuous Integration and Deployment setup for generated projects.

GitHub Actions
--------------

Test Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: yaml

   # .github/workflows/test.yml
   name: Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.12'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: make install-dev
         - name: Run tests
           run: make test-cov

Deploy Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: yaml

   # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   name: Deploy

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Build image
           run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
         - name: Deploy
           run: |
             # Your deployment commands

GitLab CI
---------

.. code-block:: yaml

   # .gitlab-ci.yml
   stages:
     - test
     - build
     - deploy

   test:
     stage: test
     script:
       - make install-dev
       - make test

   build:
     stage: build
     script:
       - docker build -t myapp:latest .

   deploy:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - # Deployment commands

Best Practices
--------------

* Run tests on every push
* Deploy only from main branch
* Use environment secrets
* Enable branch protection
* Require passing tests for merge
